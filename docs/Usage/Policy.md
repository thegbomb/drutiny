# Policy Usage

Policy objects define how an audit in Drutiny should assess a given target.
Drutiny has a library of policies to choose from provided by a collection
of pluggable sources.

## Discover

To find what policies are available in your instance of Drutiny, us the
`policy:list`command.

```
drutiny policy:list
```

This should provide you with a table of available policies including the policy
title, name, source and profile utilisation.

Drutiny defaults to english but will provides policies in other languages if
your Policy sources support multilingual policies.

```
# List policies written in Japanese.
drutiny policy:list --language=ja
```

## Policy information

The title and name of the policy should be indicative of what the policy
audits for and assesses. To find out more information, use the `policy:info`
command to see the description and parameters used in the audit.

```
drutiny policy:info <policy:name>
```

The output from this command should also give you an example of how to audit
a target against this policy.

## Auditing a target against a policy.

Using the `policy:audit` command you can assess a single policy against a single
target.

```
drutiny policy:audit <policy:name> <target>
```

Use the name column from the `policy:list`command as the `<policy:name>`
argument. The target argument should be an identifier from the `target:list <source>`
command. See [Target Usage](Target.md) for more information.
